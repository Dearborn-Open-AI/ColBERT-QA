## ColBERT-QA: Relevance-guided Supervision for OpenQA (TACL'21)

### ColBERT-QA is a state-of-the-art system for answering open questions given a large corpus of text like Wikipedia.

ColBERT-QA extends the scalable ColBERT retriever for OpenQA. It introduces Relevance-Guided Supervision (RGS), an iterative weak-supervision strategy that efficiently samples accurate positives and challenging negatives for training.



### Implementation

The system implementation lives as part of the [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) repository.

After cloning, make sure you obtain the code for the submodule too:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

More detailed instructions coming soon.
